# Starter Angular

A simple Angular starter project using the following frameworks.

- `Angular`
- `Prettier`
- `Tailwind CSS`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

The starter app is configured to auto update dependencies with `Dependabot` and it's a piece of :cake: to deploy this app to `Vercel`.

Import your project directly from `Git` and `Vercel` will automatically set `FRAMEWORK PRESET` to `Angular`.

To skip preview builds for PR's raised by `Dependabot`:

> Settings > Git > Ignore Build Step > set `COMMAND` to `bash vercel.sh`
